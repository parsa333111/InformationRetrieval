    <h1>Information Retrieval Project</h1>
</head>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project focuses on information retrieval using a dataset sourced from Farsnews. The dataset contains a
        collection of documents that will be utilized to build a system for retrieving relevant information based on user
        queries. By leveraging techniques such as text processing, indexing, and retrieval algorithms, this project aims
        to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval from the Farsnews dataset. The implementation will
        be carried out using Python programming language.
    </p>
